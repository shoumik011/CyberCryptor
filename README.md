# CyberCryptor
## Objective

CyberCryptor is a Python project aimed at demonstrating encryption and decryption techniques using dictionaries. The project allows users to encode and decode messages using a custom encoder and decoder dictionaries. It serves as a practical exercise in cybersecurity fundamentals, providing hands-on experience with encryption algorithms.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing encryption and decryption algorithms in Python
- Working with dictionaries to map characters for encoding and decoding
- Handling user input and menu-driven interactions
- Understanding basic cybersecurity principles related to data encryption

### Tools Used

- *Python*: The project is implemented in Python, a versatile programming language suitable for various applications, including cybersecurity
- *GitHub*: The code is hosted on GitHub, facilitating version control, collaboration, and showcasing of projects
- *Integrated Development Environment (IDE)*: Any Python-compatible IDE such as PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook can be used for development

## Steps
1. *Input Message*: Prompt the user to input a string, ensuring it contains only characters allowed for encoding (A-Z, 0-9, comma, space, period).
2. *Conversion*: Convert the input string to uppercase to ensure uniformity.
3. *Encoding/Decoding Choice*: Ask the user whether they want to encode or decode the message (E/D).
4. *Encoding Process*:
  - If the user chooses encoding, iterate through each character in the input string.<br>
  - Use the encoder dictionary to map each character to its encoded version.<br>
  - Print the encoded message.<br>
6. *Decoding Process*:
  - If the user chooses decoding, iterate through each character in the input string.<br>
  - Use the decoder dictionary to map each character to its decoded version.<br>
  - Print the decoded message.
7. *Repeat or Exit*: Ask the user if they want to perform another encoding/decoding operation. If yes, repeat the process from step 1; if no, exit the program.
